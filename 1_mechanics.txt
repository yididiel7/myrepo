Usage
System copy provides a mapping to copy to the system clipboard using a motion or visual selection. It also provides a mapping for pasting from the system clipboard.

The default mapping is cp for copying and cv for pasting, and can be followed by any motion or text object. For instance:

cpiw => copy word into system clipboard
cpi' => copy inside single quotes to system clipboard
cvi' => paste inside single quotes from system clipboard
In addition, cP is mapped to copy the current line directly.

The sequence cV is mapped to paste the content of system clipboard to the next line.
