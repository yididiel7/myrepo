The X command deletes the character under the coursor. When we use the
dot command in this context, "repeat last change" tells Vim to delete the
character under the cursor:

We can restore the file to its original state by pressing the u key a few times
to undo the changes. The dd command also performs a deletion, but this one acts
on the current line as a whole.

If we use the dot command after dd , then “repeat last change”
instructs Vim to delete the current line:

--------------------------
{start} Line one
        Line two
        Line three
        Line four

dd      Line two
        Line three
        Line four

.       Line three
        Line four

Finally, the >G command increases the indentation from the current line until
the end of the file. If we follow this command with the dot command, then
“repeat last change” tells Vim to increase the indentation level from the current
position to the end of the file. In this example, we’ll start with the cursor on
the second line to highlight the difference.

The x , dd , and > commands are all executed from Normal mode, but we also
create a change each time we dip into Insert mode. From the moment we
enter Insert mode (by pressing i , for example) until we return to Normal mode
(by pressing <Esc> ), Vim records every keystroke. After making a change such
as this, the dot command will replay our keystrokes
